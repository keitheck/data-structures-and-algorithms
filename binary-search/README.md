# Binary Search

## Return index of sorted array with no biult in methods

### Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Example data:
```
Input	                      Output
[4,8,15,16,23,42], 15	       2
[11,22,33,44,55,66,77], 90	  -1
```
