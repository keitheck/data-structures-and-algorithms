### Towers of Hanoi

- as the introduction to recursion I started by writing a simple countdown ```recursive_function()``` to illustrate what whas happening in recursion.  Call the function with an integer n ```recursive_function(n)``` 

- next I solved the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursion.  I used a second ```visual()``` function to print what was happening during recursion.  Watch in your terminal my calling with integer n ```tower(n)```
