# Implement a K-ary Tree

- Create a Class or a Node which is aware of the value as val and children as a list collection of Nodes
- Ensure that you have a __repr__ and __str__ method defined to return appropriate representations of the node
- Create a Class for a KTree, which is aware of the root of the tree as root
- Ensure that you have a __repr__ and __str__ method defined to return appropriate representations of the tree
- This class should be aware of depth-first traversal methods for pre_order, and post_order traversals
- This class should be aware of a breadth-first traversal method
- This class should have the ability to insert a new node into the tree at a given parent node
