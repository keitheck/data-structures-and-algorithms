### LINKED LIST LAB 05
-implement a Singly Linked List

### 3-26 Whiteboard 06 added.
-implemented append, insertAfter and insertBefore methods to our Linked List.

### 3-27 Whiteboard 07 added.
-Write a method for the Linked List class called kthFromEnd which takes a number, k, as an argument. Return the node that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges. â€‹

### 3-28 Whiteboard 08 added.
-Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the single list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

### 3-29 Whiteboard 08 added.
-Write a method for the Linked List class called hasLoop which takes no arguments. Return a boolean that indicates whether or not a circular reference or loop is present in the linked list. Your implementation must not use any additional memory or modify the nodes of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
